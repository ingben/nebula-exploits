# Goal

The goal is to find a setuid program that runs as user level00.

# Approach

* check current user `id`. turns out we are level00:level00
* check `man find`
** figure out how to search for files with certain permissions. turns out there is a `-perm` flag
** google for bitmask of setuid bit => 4000
* `find / -perm -4000 | more`
* note the file `/rofs/bin/.../flag00`. examine it with `ls -al /rofs/bin/.../flag00` => got it.
* run `/rofs/bin/.../flag00`
* run `getflag`
* done.
